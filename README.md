# Contact-Us-page
This contact page was my contribution to a school website created collectively during codePlateau V2.0 held in Jos, Plateau State in 2021 under Mr David Daser
The code in contact.html produced the complete contact page.
The three screenshots are samples of the final result after the coding.
Viewing the screenshots, you will see one of the screenshots depicting how responsive the page is even in mobile view.
